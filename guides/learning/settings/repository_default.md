## Default branch: **main**

Soramitsu Khmer are considering renaming the default branch name of their repository from `master` to `main`.

We're committed to making the renaming process as seamless as possible for project maintainers and all of their contributors. This repository is our up-to-date guidance on how and when to rename your default branch.
