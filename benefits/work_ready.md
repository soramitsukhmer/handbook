# Work Ready

We know you're ready to work and so we want you to be work ready. We'll equip you with a brand new Macbook or PC, monitor, keyboard, adapters, and whatever other technical equipment you need to do your job. If you want a book, some software or you just want to go to a conference, it is on us. We just ask you to be reasonable with your spending.

Here's some examples of things people have purchased:

- New monitor
- Adapters (HDMI, USB, etc.)
- Keyboards
- Desks
- Ergonomic chairs, stools, stands
